# Bitburner-scripts
My scripts for the game bitburner

purchaseServer.script buys the biggest server you can with the money you have

Copycat attacks all servers and spreads as much as it can and gets their name, needs attack.script, genhack.script, and getName.script

makeServerList.script creates serverList.txt with all the servers that getName.script ran on

hackServers.script runs the genhack.script on all the servers in serverList.txt

The genhack.script can be stopped by running the terminate.script

towerSetup.script runs watchTower.script on all the servers you own requires watchTower, hacker, grower, and weaker
