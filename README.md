# Bitburner-scripts
My scripts for the game bitburner

purchaseServer.script buys the biggest server you can with the money you have

altScan scans all the servers and give you a list called altScan.txt

hackServers.script gives you root access on and then runs the genhack.script on all the servers in altScan.txt that you can hack

The genhack.script weakens,grows, and hacks servers and can be stopped by running the terminate.script

towerSetup.script runs watchTower.script on all the servers you own. requires running altScan.script and validateServerList.script first, and requires watchTower, hacker, grower, and weaker scripts to be in your home
